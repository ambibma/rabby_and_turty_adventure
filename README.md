# About the Development Process
Raby and Turty is a Team Week #2 group project created for the Dino Cohort 2022-2023 at Epicodus. Students had two weeks to colloborate on a application of their choosing. We decided to create a video game in Unity to demonstrate and apply our learned knowledge of C#. Each team member is soley responsible for the creation to of this game. From 3D photoscanning models into 2D sprites, to AI generated tilemaps and enviorments clipped and customized to meet our standards. Music and sounds were originally recorded to be put into the game as well as menu assets. 

## About the Game
Rabby and Turty started off as an inside joke between the Epicodus Dino Cohort 2023 that snowballed into a videogame with a story. Rabby and Turty are mysterously escaping from the facility in which they were held in. They must use their unique abilities to escape and break free. 


## Technologies Used
* Unity/C#
* Ableton
* DallE
* Udemy Unity Course


## Setup/Installation Requirements
In order to play Raby and Turty, in the versions of the repo you will see a downloadable executable, along with the assets needed to play the game. Playing is as simple as un-zipping the project and double clicking the .exe. 
If on MAC, there are two ways, one would be using a virtual machine such as Parallels to run the game, or if you have Unity Hub and Editor, downloading the repo might be the best bet and opening the project with Unity.
